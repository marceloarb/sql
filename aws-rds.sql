The reason I am creating my db in AWS-RDS it's because Amir gave a demo session about
it and AWS is very important to learn. 
The steps I took was:
Loggin to my aws account.
Select RDS -> create database -> mysql -> free tier.
Create a user = marcelo and password = marcelobarbosa;
The rest was a default and my database was created after submit.
Go to dashboard -> databases -> select the database you want.
Here is my instance: bonussql.cneslkijzdx1.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
